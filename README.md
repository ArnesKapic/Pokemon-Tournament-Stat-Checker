# Pokemon-Tournament-Stat-Checker
This Python program uses a machine learning model built with scikit-learn and a styled command-line interface using Colorama to determine whether a Pok√©mon is Legendary or Non-Legendary based on its base stats. The application includes a team management system that allows tournament organizers or players to easily build, classify, and manage teams.
