# 🧠 Pokémon Tournament Stat Checker

Welcome to the **Legendary Pokémon Tournament Stat Checker**!  
This CLI-based Python app helps trainers predict whether a Pokémon is **Legendary** based on its base stats using a trained Machine Learning model. You can look up Pokémon by name, enter custom stats, and even build a tournament team of six.

---

## 🎮 Features

- 🔍 **Stat Prediction**  
  Enter stats manually or by name to determine if a Pokémon is Legendary.

- 📊 **Machine Learning Classification**  
  Uses a Random Forest model trained on real Pokémon data.

- 🧩 **Name Lookup & Type Emojis**  
  Instantly fetch stats by Pokémon name and see their types as emojis (e.g., 🔥, ⚡).

- 🧠 **Tournament Team Builder**  
  Build and manage a team of 6 Pokémon, classify them, and save your team.

- 🎨 **Pokémon-themed UI**  
  Styled CLI interface with emoji-enhanced menus and helpful prompts.
